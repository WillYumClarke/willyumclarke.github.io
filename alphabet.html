    <h2>Alphabet Reordering</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Something that caught my eye recently was an experiment Brian Kell did back in 2010, he made an attempt to find what order you could put the alphabet into to yield the most English words as substrings (a substring is a smaller word present in a larger word, like the word sub is a substring of substring).</p>
    <p>His page walking through his experiment can be found here: <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~bkell/alpha-order/" target="_blank" id="'link">Brian Kell</a></p>

    <h3>Size of Experiment</h3>
    <h4>Alphabet</h4>
    <p>The first thing to consider in this experiment is how many different reordering’s of the alphabet you can possible make, and it’s quite simple, 26!, or 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000, or 4.0329146e+26. However you write it, the number of possible combinations is impossible to fathom and it would be impossible to generate all possible combinations before the sun swallows up the earth. Given this fact, along with searching for both the reordering with the most and least words, I see no point in attempting to test reordering’s in any sort of order or sensical fashion and instead using mans age old best friend, random chance. </p>
    <h4>Words</h4>
    <p>The words list contains 67,230 words, it should be less, AA should be removed because its not in alphabetical order but if I want to beat Kell I have to play by his rules.</p>


    <h4>High Score<h4>
    <p>My current high score is BDTZCJFQHAIULGMVOKWNPERXSY which contains 2279 words where Kells is FCBWHJLOAQUXMPVINTKGZERDYS with 4046 words</p>
